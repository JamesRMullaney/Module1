James Mullaney, section  01 

I am currently enrolled in the Data Science program with an emphasis in Computer Science. I will be graduating December 2020.

I'm from St. Louis, which is near where I receiver my associates degree before transferring to Northwest Missouri State. My associates is in Computer Science but discovered I wanted to work with data / in data sciences when I looked more into future positions and was lucky enough to have transferred to a school with a dedicated data science degree path. Hobby wise, I love to golf but hate to look at my scorecard after completing a round of golf.

I hope to work in a Data analyst position somewhere in either Des Moines or Omaha. Although, getting a position somewhere warmer would be a nice touch so I could work on my golf game year round.
